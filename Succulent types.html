              <p class="lead"> Aloe juvenna is shaped like a shark's jaw, for those who love thrills and uniqueness. The tree has quite thin leaf blades and small spines on the leaf edges that resemble shark teeth. Perhaps that is why it is called shark jaw lotus.
Shark jaw lotus originates from Zanzibar (an island country on the coast of Tanzania) which always has a dry climate all year round, so it has very good drought resistance. When the plant wilts, you just need to water it. Water will make the plant fresh again. The green shark-jaw lotus leaves grow around with sharp thorns that look "ferocious". The tree is suitable for people with strong personalities who do not give up before life's difficulties. Therefore, trees are often used as gifts for friends, colleagues, and relatives, accompanied by the message "try hard, failure only comes when we give up".</p>
